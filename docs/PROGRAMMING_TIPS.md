## Naming A Function

Naming a function is as important as writing codes. 
A function name is important to be clear and precise. 
Consider the following recommendations when you name your function. 

- Choose meaningful words. 
  When you name your function, you should be clear on what it does. 
  On Function name `get(studentId, subject)`, you can't tell what it is geting mark for or what it is getting or whether it is getting Studnet name or Age or their marks. 
  Function `getStudentGrade(studentId, subject)` told you everything you need to know about what it does. 
  It will return the student grade.
###Â Don't make the function name too long

Take care not to make a function name too long. 
For example,  `checkStudentFailOrPassOrMeritOrDistinction(mark)` is an unnecessarily long function name. 
The longer the name is, the harder it gets to remember and the more space it takes on the computer screen.

### Don't make the function name too short
Conversely, making a function name too short can also confuse readers. 
For example, `checkFPMD(mark)` is a bad function name as it isn't immediately obvious what 'FPMD' means.

### Use the name that everyone understands. 

Your function name should be understandable by everyone who reads your code. 
For example, an obscure function name like `DeathStar()` might be amusing to you, but the name doesn't communicate its purpose.

### Pick one convention for naming operations

Stick to one convention for naming operations that do the same thing. 
For example, if you name the function to get a student's name `getStudentName()`, you should not use a different verb in the function name to get a student's grade  (e.g. `retrieveStudentGrade()`).
### Avoid using the same word for two purposes

For example, don't keep using 'add' when you want to put a group of items into a collection. 
Use 'insert' or 'append' instead.
